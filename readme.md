## What is this?

This is my minimal config (setup), tailored to work with multiple operating systems with as little as possible, while providing the best possible DX, and performance possible.

- **Minimal.** A setup that is close to metal. Try to work with OS built-ins, and rely on very few [applications & binaries](./brew/Brewfile)
- **Performance is paramount.** No matter the operating system, prioritize startup and run-time performance. Try not to _automatically_ install dependencies. Lazy-load them wherever possible to make everything feel snappier
- **Replicable, and recognizable.** Every environment should feel [familiar](#system), or as close to `$HOME` as possible
