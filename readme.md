## What is this?

This is my minimal config (setup), tailored to work with multiple operating systems with as little as possible, while providing the best possible DX, and performance possible.

- **Minimal.** A setup that is close to metal. Try to work with OS built-ins, and rely on very few [applications & binaries](./brew/Brewfile)
- **Performance is paramount.** No matter the operating system, prioritize startup and run-time performance. Try not to _automatically_ install dependencies. Lazy-load them wherever possible to make everything feel snappier
- **Replicable, and recognizable.** Every environment should feel [familiar](#system), or as close to `$HOME` as possible

## üõ† Developer Tools

- [Browsers](#browsers)
  - [Brave](https://brave.com/)
  - [Firefox Nightly](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Nightly)
- [Editor](#editor)
  - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) in [portable mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable)
  - [Zed](https://zed.dev/)\*
- [Terminal Emulator](#terminal-emulator)
  - iTerm2

###### _\*Currently testing it out_

### üåè Browsers

#### Details

For the most part, I use Brave with [Shields](https://brave.com/shields/) up. In instances where a site is completely broken, or refuses to work in Brave, I use FF Nightly with a very slightly extended [`user.js`](./firefox/user-overrides.js).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Editor

I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) instead of VS Code[^2].

> **Note**
> Moving forward, VS Code and VSCodium are used interchangeably

#### Extensions

VSCodium comes with some built-in extensions, all of which are enabled by default. Hit <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚áß shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>, then search for `@builtin` to bring up the list. Instead of disabling these though, I would suggest installing extensions sparingly.

#### Details

- Editor-wide global settings
  - [VSCodium](.config/vscode/settings.json)
  - [Zed](.config/zed/settings.json)
- Font is [Lilex](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts/blob/master/Casks/font-lilex-nerd-font.rb)

### üöü Terminal Emulator

I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with `zsh` as the `$SHELL`, backed by [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug). Startup time is very paramount here, so I am constantly working on my shell config to make it feel more snappy. Here‚Äôs a handy [script](.config/zsh/conf.d/functions.zsh#L66-L68) to measure your shell startup times. It is fairly accurate, but for more realistic benchmarks, use [`zsh-bench`](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-bench).

#### Details

- [Custom](.config/starship/config.toml) [starship](https://starship.rs) prompt
- [Forest Blue](https://github.com/olkinn/forest-blue-iTerm) color theme
- Font is [Caskaydia Cove](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts/blob/master/Casks/font-caskaydia-cove-nerd-font.rb) (patched via [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads))
- [Plugins](.config/zplug/load.zsh) are loaded asynchronously

## System

Follow the [XDG Base Directory](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) specification wherever possible.[^3] That includes macOS as well. While macOS is based on a flavor of BSD-Linux, Apple chooses to organize directories and files [very differently](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672).[^4] If you‚Äôre using macOS like me, then you‚Äôre going to have to deal with applications taking up space in `/Library/Application\ Support` and `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/`.

Here‚Äôs my default directories:

```sh
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache};
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config};
export XDG_DATA_HOME=${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share};
export XDG_STATE_HOME=${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state};
```

> **Warning**
> Do not set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` on macOS. A lot of applications _could_ break if you do.
