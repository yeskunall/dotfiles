## What is this?

This is my opinionated minimal config (setup), tailored to work with macOS with as little as possible while providing the best possible DX and performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- **Minimal.** A setup that is close to metal. Try to work with OS built-ins, and rely on very few [applications & binaries](./brew/Brewfile).
- **Performance is paramount.** Prioritize startup and run-time performance. Try not to _automatically_ install dependencies. Lazy-load them wherever possible to make everything feel snappier.
- **Replicable, and recognizable.** Every environment should feel familiar, or as close to `$HOME` as possible.
